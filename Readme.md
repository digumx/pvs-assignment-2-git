This is a git repository for submitting the PVS part of Assignment 2 of the Interactive Theorem Proving course at Chennai Mathematical Institute for the session January-April 2020.

There are three branches in this git repository.

* **master** contains the `.pvs` and `.prf` files for all problems. The written answers for the problems are in the `answers.md` file.
* **edit-liftifex** contains the files with proofs and answers for `liftifex`.
* **edit-sum-plus** contains the files with proofs and answers for `sum_plus`.
* **edit-opsem** contains the edits with answers for `opsem`.
* **edit-opsemstates** contains the files and edites corresponding to `opsemwithstates4class.pvs` as specified by problem `C.2`.
* **majority-problem** contains the pvs specification and proofs for defining and proving the soundness of the majority finding algorithm that uses a single counter to find the majority element of a voting list, provided one exists.
