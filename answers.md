## Question A.1:
### Part a:

The required proof is saved into `sum_plus.prf` as `sum_of_squares_1`.

### Part b:

The automated proof is saved into `sum_plus.prf` as `sum_of_squares_auto`.

### Part c:

Replacing the `(auto_rewrite_defs)` with `(auto_rewrite_theory "sum_plus")` in `sum_of_squares` did successfully prove the
lemma in my case. The rewrite rules generated included all rewrite rules generated by the original `(auto_rewrite_defs)`,
and also had an extra rewrite rule pertaining to the lemma `sum_plus`.

### Part d:

Since the proof worked, no modification was needed.
